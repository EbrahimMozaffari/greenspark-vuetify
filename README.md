- Change widget colors dynamically.
- Activate a single widget while deactivating others.
- Link widgets to a public profile.
- Fully responsive design using Vuetify.js.
- Custom toggle switches and color pickers.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Vue 3**: For building the user interface.
- **Vuex**: For state management.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **Vuetify.js**: For styling.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.

```bash
        src/
        ├── components/        # Reusable components
        ├── store/             # Vuex store for managing global state

## How It Works

### Widget Management

- Each widget is displayed with its type, action, and color.
  **Users can** :
- Change colors via a color picker.
- Activate or deactivate widgets using toggle switches.
- Link widgets to a public profile.

### State Management

**Vuex manages the widget data, with actions like**:

- **fetchWidgets**: Fetches the list of widgets from the API.
- **updateWidgetColor**: Updates a widget's color.
- **toggleActiveWidget**: Activates one widget and deactivates others.
- **updateWidgetLink**: Links/unlinks widgets to profiles.
